At our request, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless MCF, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries, and agents from all damages, liabilities, claims and expenses, including without limitation attorneys' fees and costs, arising from: (i) your Content; (ii) your acts, omissions, or use of the Service, including without limitation your negligent, willful or illegal conduct; (iii) your breach or alleged breach by you of this Agreement, including without limitation your representations and warranties relating to your Content; (iv) your violation or anticipatory violation of any applicable law, rule or order in connection with your use of or activities in the Service; (v) information or material transmitted through your Device that infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Right; (vi) any misrepresentation made by you; and or (vii) MCF's use of the information that you submit to us. 
</MoreInfo><MoreInfo title="9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION"><p></p>
By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you also agree to arbitrate any and all claims against MCF pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act and subject to the terms below (the "Agreement to Arbitrate"). You and MCF agree that this Section satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act and further agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate. 
<p></p><b>9.1 If a dispute arises between you and MCF regarding a claim, you and we agree to alternative dispute resolution.</b><p></p> 
Our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. If any controversy, allegation or claim arises out of or relates to the Service, the Website(s), the Content, your Content, this Agreement, your decision to enter into this Agreement, any Additional Terms or any other aspect of your relationship with MCF (collectively, "Dispute"), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information (including email address) that you provide us. You are obligated to ensure that such contact information is current and accurate. Your notice to us must be sent to: legal@musicoin.org Attention: General Counsel. 
IN THE EVENT THAT WE CANNOT RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS OF RECEIPT OF SUCH NOTICE, THEN EITHER YOU OR WE MAY ELECT TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO FORMAL ARBITRATION AS HEREINAFTER DESCRIBED. WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.
All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. An arbitration hearing will be conducted, at your election, either by telephone (or other mutually agreeable remote technology).
Should either you or MCF elect to resolve the Dispute by way of binding arbitration, the arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $1,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single, neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than ten (10) years' experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $1,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three (3) member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will chair the panel) selected by the two (2) party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of this Agreement and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award. 
If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a "demand for arbitration," then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. ("JAMS") using JAMS' streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and a legal officer of MCF consent to in writing, except, as noted above, that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action. The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $10,000,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or other arbitration service. 
AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information can be reviewed here:
AAA: <a href="https://www.adr.org/">AAA</a> 
JAMS: <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">JAMS</a> 
The arbitrator's decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator must honor the terms of this Agreement and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys' fees) consistent with applicable law. 
<p></p><b>9.2 Exceptions to Arbitration Requirement.</b><p></p>
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, either party may seek judicial relief from any court of competent jurisdiction (a) to enforce an arbitral award issued hereunder, (b) to compel arbitration required hereunder or (c) to obtain temporary injunctive relief to prevent imminent and irreparable harm or to preserve the status quo until an arbitrator can be empaneled and determine whether to continue, terminate or modify any such relief. In the event of a request for temporary injunctive relief, the requirement for 60 days' dialogue before an arbitration can be initiated shall not apply.

</MoreInfo><MoreInfo title="12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration">
By agreeing to the Terms, you also agree to arbitrate any and all claims against MCF pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act and subject to the terms below (the "Agreement to Arbitrate"). You and MCF agree that this Section satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act and further agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate. 
<p></p><b>12.1 If a dispute arises between you and MCF regarding a claim, you and we agree to alternative dispute resolution. </b><p></p>
Our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. If any controversy, allegation or claim arises out of or relates to the Service, the Website(s), the Content, your Artist Content, this Agreement, your decision to enter into this Agreement, any Additional Terms or any other aspect of your relationship with MCF (collectively, "Dispute"), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information (including email address) that you provide us. You are obligated to ensure that such contact information is current and accurate. 
Your notice to us must be sent to: legal@musicoin.org Attention: General Counsel. 
IN THE EVENT THAT WE CANNOT RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS OF RECEIPT OF SUCH NOTICE, THEN EITHER YOU OR WE MAY ELECT TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO FORMAL ARBITRATION AS HEREINAFTER DESCRIBED. WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.
All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. An arbitration hearing will be conducted, at your election, either by telephone (or other mutually agreeable remote technology).
Should either you or MCF elect to resolve the Dispute by way of binding arbitration, the arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $1,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single, neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than ten (10) years' experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $1,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three (3) member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will chair the panel) selected by the two (2) party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of this Agreement and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award. 
If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a "demand for arbitration," then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. ("JAMS") using JAMS' streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and a legal officer of MCF consent to in writing, except, as noted above, that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action. The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $10,000,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or other arbitration service. 
AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information can be reviewed here:
AAA: <a href="https://www.adr.org/">AAA</a> 
JAMS: <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">JAMS</a> 
The arbitrator's decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator must honor the terms of this Agreement and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys' fees) consistent with applicable law. 
<p></p><b>12.2 Exceptions to Arbitration Requirement</b><p></p>
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, either party may seek judicial relief from any court of competent jurisdiction (a) to enforce an arbitral award issued hereunder, (b) to compel arbitration required hereunder or (c) to obtain temporary injunctive relief to prevent imminent and irreparable harm or to preserve the status quo until an arbitrator can be empaneled and determine whether to continue, terminate or modify any such relief. In the event of a request for temporary injunctive relief, the requirement for 60 days' dialogue before an arbitration can be initiated shall not apply.

Please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly, materially misrepresent that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Terms of Service, or any other terms applicable to your use of the Service, we reserve the right to take no action upon receipt of any DMCA Counter-Notification. 
If MCF receives a DMCA Counter-Notification that complies with the terms of 17 U.S.C. § 512(g), then we may forward it to the person who filed the original DMCA Notice.
In that event, if we do not receive notice from that person within 10 business days that they are seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we may, in our sole discretion, replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed.
Without limiting our other rights, MCF will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer's access to the Service and any other property owned or operated by MCF.

Please note that these notifications are real-world legal notices. MCF may provide copies of such notices to the participants in the dispute or third parties, at our discretion and/or as required by law. The MCF Privacy Policy does not protect information provided in these notices.
