A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique
identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored
on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are required to use some Musicoin services.
Musicoin and its ad management partners (“Ad Partners”) use cookies to record
current session information.

Our Ad Partners may also from time to time use web beacons (also known as Internet
tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons are provided by our Ad Partners
and allow Ad Partners to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer
that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which
the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type
of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the Ad
Partners. Web beacons enable our Ad Partners to recognize a unique cookie on your
web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users
to our Website.

With both cookies and web beacon technology, the information that we collect and
share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your
name, address, telephone number, or email address.
