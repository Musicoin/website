			Musicoin Foundation (“MCF”) will respond to notices of alleged
			infringement that comply with the DMCA and other applicable laws. The
			following notice requirements are intended to comply with MCF rights and
			obligations under the DMCA and, in particular, section 512(c), and do not
			constitute legal advice. Before serving either a Notice of Infringing
			Material or Counter-Notification, you may wish to contact a lawyer to
			better understand your rights and obligations under the DMCA and other
			applicable laws. As part of our response, we may remove or disable access
			to material on our site that is claimed to be infringing, in which case we
			will make a good-faith attempt to contact the person who submitted the
			affected material so that they may make a counter notification, also in
			accordance with the DMCA.
			<p />
			<b>Submit Notice of Infringing Material</b>

			<p />
			Please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any
			damages, including costs and attorneys&apos; fees incurred by us or our
			users, if you knowingly, materially misrepresent that material or activity
			was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification. Notwithstanding
			anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the
			Terms of Service, or any other terms applicable to your use of the
			Service, we reserve the right to take no action upon receipt of any DMCA
			Counter-Notification. If MCF receives a DMCA Counter-Notification that
			complies with the terms of 17 U.S.C. § 512(g), then we may forward it to
			the person who filed the original DMCA Notice. In that event, if we do not
			receive notice from that person within 10 business days that they are
			seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at
			issue, we may, in our sole discretion, replace or cease disabling access
			to the material that was removed. Without limiting our other rights, MCF
			will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer&apos;s
			access to the Service and any other property owned or operated by MCF.
