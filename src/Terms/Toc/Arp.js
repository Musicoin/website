				your Artist Content, this Agreement, your decision to enter into this
				Agreement, any Additional Terms or any other aspect of your relationship
				with MCF (collectively, &quot;Dispute&quot;), then you and we agree to

				(including email address) that you provide us. You are obligated to
				ensure that such contact information is current and accurate. Your
				notice to us must be sent to: legal@musicoin.org Attention: General
				Counsel. IN THE EVENT THAT WE CANNOT RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITHIN SIXTY (60)

				ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION
				PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN
				CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION
				OUTCOME IS LIMITED. All parties to the arbitration will have the right,
				at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate
				of their choosing. An arbitration hearing will be conducted, at your
				election, either by telephone (or other mutually agreeable remote
				technology). Should either you or MCF elect to resolve the Dispute by
				way of binding arbitration, the arbitration shall proceed in accordance
				with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
				Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;). If the Dispute has a claimed
				value of not more than $1,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard
				and determined by a single, neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or
				a lawyer with not less than ten (10) years&apos; experience as a
				practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to
				the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the
				AAA&apos;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If
				the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $1,000,000, then the
				arbitration will be heard and determined by a three (3) member panel,
				with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will
				chair the panel) selected by the two (2) party-appointed members or by
				the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. The
				arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply
				applicable law and the provisions of this Agreement and any Additional
				Terms, will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts
				based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned
				award. If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal
				arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date
				within sixty (60) days of the filing of a &quot;demand for
				arbitration,&quot; then either party can elect to have the arbitration
				administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc.
				(&quot;JAMS&quot;) using JAMS&apos; streamlined Arbitration Rules and
				Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you
				and a legal officer of MCF consent to in writing, except, as noted
				above, that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or
				representative action. The substantive practice area requirements for
				the arbitrator and the $10,000,000 threshold for the number of
				arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above
				will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or other arbitration
				service. AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information can be
				reviewed here: AAA: <a href="https://www.adr.org/">AAA</a>
				JAMS: <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">JAMS</a>
				The arbitrator&apos;s decision must consist of a written statement
				stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a
				statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the

				arbitrator can be empaneled and determine whether to continue, terminate
				or modify any such relief. In the event of a request for temporary
				injunctive relief, the requirement for 60 days&apos; dialogue before an
				arbitration can be initiated shall not apply.
